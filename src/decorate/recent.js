      Mia's mission is to enrich the community by collecting, preserving, and
      making accessible outstanding works of art from the world’s diverse
      cultures. To accomplish this goal, Mia curators continually search for
        important works of art to add to the collection. The objects are vetted
      by the director and trustee committee before being formally added to the
      museum’s inventory. These objects make Mia an exciting place of discovery
      and learning about humanity’s diverse forms of expression. Each newly
      accessioned object enriches the collection by offering greater
      perspective on an artist, era, or culture. In the galleries, such objects
      are typically identified by “Recent Acquisition” stickers on their
      labels.
